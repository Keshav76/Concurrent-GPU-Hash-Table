Here are several reasons why your deferred displacement with temp slots implementation could be better than the original DyCuckoo approach:

1. Faster Insertions (O(1) Insert Time in Most Cases)
Original: Insertions can trigger long, recursive displacement chains (kick-outs), especially at high load, leading to unpredictable and sometimes very slow insert times.

Deferred/Temp Slot: By deferring the actual placement of displaced items to future insertions and using a temp slot, each insert operation is almost always a simple placement, avoiding the recursive chain in the critical path. This makes the average insert time much closer to O(1), improving throughput and predictability.

2. Reduced Lock Contention and Better Concurrency
Original: Long displacement chains require holding locks across multiple buckets/tables, increasing contention and reducing scalability in concurrent environments.

Deferred/Temp Slot: Since each insert only touches a single table and deferred items are handled incrementally, lock holding times are shorter and contention is reduced, improving scalability and multi-threaded performance.

3. Lower Probability of Endless Loops and Insert Failures
Original: Recursive displacement can result in cycles or endless loops, requiring expensive rehashes or stashing, especially at high load factors.

Deferred/Temp Slot: The temp slot acts like a mini-stash per table, providing a buffer for problematic insertions. This reduces the likelihood of hitting the rehash/stash threshold, making the table more robust at high load.

4. More Predictable Latency
Original: Insert latency is highly variable due to the possibility of long or cyclic displacement chains.

Deferred/Temp Slot: Since inserts are not blocked by recursive chains, latency is much more predictable and consistent, which is valuable for real-time or latency-sensitive applications.

5. Minimal Impact on Lookup Performance
Original: Lookup is already O(1) (check k locations for k tables).

Deferred/Temp Slot: Lookup now checks k main slots plus k temp slots, a small constant increase. Since k is small, overall lookup performance remains O(1) and competitive with the original.

6. Better Performance at High Load Factors
Original: Insertion performance degrades rapidly as table load increases, due to more frequent and longer displacement chains.

Deferred/Temp Slot: The temp slot buffer helps smooth out insertion pressure, allowing the table to operate efficiently at higher load factors before rehashing is needed.

7. Simplicity and Flexibility
Original: Handling recursive kick-outs and rehashing logic is complex and error-prone.

Deferred/Temp Slot: The logic for deferring displaced items is straightforward, and the temp slot approach can be easily tuned or extended (e.g., more than one slot, or per-bucket stashes).

8. Inspired by Proven Techniques
Similar ideas (e.g., stash-based cuckoo hashing, blocked cuckoo hashing, multi-copy cuckoo) have been shown to improve robustness and performance by adding small auxiliary structures to buffer problematic insertions.

In summary:
Your deferred displacement with temp slots implementation addresses the main pain points of classic cuckoo hashing—slow, unpredictable insertions and poor concurrency—while maintaining its hallmark O(1) lookups and high space efficiency. It is especially advantageous for workloads with high insertion rates, high load factors, or multi-threaded/concurrent access patterns
